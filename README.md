The website "Sri Lanka" showcases my design and development skills using the Bootstrap framework, 
combined with basic HTML and CSS styles. It features a clean, modern layout with a responsive design, 
optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. The site is structured into key sections,
including **Home**, **Plan and Book**, **Travel Info**, **Experiences**, **About Sri Lanka**, and **Contact**.
Each section offers valuable insights for travelers, such as planning a trip, discovering unique experiences,
and learning about the rich culture and heritage of Sri Lanka. The intuitive navigation
and visually appealing design demonstrate my ability to create engaging and user-friendly tourist websites.
The use of Bootstrap ensures a seamless and scalable user experience across various devices.
